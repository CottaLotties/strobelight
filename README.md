#Strobe light

A simple stroboscopic light application which turns the camera flash light on and off based on configurable delays. Both the time the light is on and the time the light is off can be configured independently to fully customise the type of flashing you require.

For best results, try a very low but not zero value for the "on" time, and a medium to low value for the "off" time.

The timing is not guaranteed to be exact, at the very high speeds the Android system might not be able to control the flash light accurately.

This application has been developed on a HTC Desire, and has only been tested on a HTC Desire. I make no guarantees that this will work on other Android devices, though it probably will if you have a back-facing camera with a flashlight.

The Camera permission is required to allow the application access to the Camera Flashlight. At no point are any pictures taken.
